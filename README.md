# SE521_datalogger
Simple code to collect live data from Center SE521 4-channel thermocouple and store in Mysql/MariaDB database.

[Center Technology](https://www.centertek.com/product_d.php?lang=en&tb=1&id=383) make a relatively low priced instrument to measure data from thermocouples.
They provide software for collecting data from MS-Windows systems, but nothing for Linux.

This software is designed for continual data collection from the instrument with DB storage.
It was written to run on Debian-based systems but should be readily adaptible for any Linux system with python, a database and a type-A USB socket.
